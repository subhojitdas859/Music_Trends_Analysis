# Music Trends Analysis *(Python, Jupyter Notebook)*
## Skills applied
*Python libraries, Exploratory Data analysis, Data cleaning, Data visualization, Documentation*
## Project Overview
- Understanding the distribution of musical attributes: EDA can help to understand the distribution of various musical attributes such as tempo, loudness, and energy in the dataset. By visualizing these distributions, we can gain insights into the characteristics of the music in the dataset and identify any outliers or anomalies.
- Identifying patterns and relationships between attributes.
- Evaluating the quality of the data.
- The libraries used were **pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn**.
- You can access the Jupiter Notebook at this [LINK](https://www.example.com)
### Questions that drive my Analysis:
- What people are listening to on Spotify?
- What kind of music genres are popular?
- Which genre has more tracks than others?
- How long are most tracks?
### Preparation and Cleaning:
- After importing the libraries we prepared the data for analysis.
- Elimination of negative values and useless columns.
- Exploration of the correlation of data.

According to this heat map, the highest correlation you can see is between loudness and energy which is (0.82). Also, the popularity has high correlations with loudness (0.36), danceability (0.26), and energy (0.25). That is similar to valence, which has high correlations with danceability (0.55), energy (0.44), and loudness (0.4). To the contrary, it has the least correlation with acousticness. **This could indicate that songs favoured on Spotify might be danceable, loud, and energetic. It could be Hip-Hop, Electronic, or Dance. For example, you can think of the fact that still many people love classic, Rock, or Blues.**
## EDA
During the exploratory data analysis, I focused on answering specific questions mentioned above and were able to draw several significant conclusions. These findings are summarized and presented below:
- sum up popularity by genre.

## Visualization
## Conclusions
- What parameters, according to Spotify data, are necessary to produce a hit song?
